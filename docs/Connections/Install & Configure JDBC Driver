KAN-7: Install & Configure SQLite JDBC Driver

Objective:
To install and configure the SQLite JDBC Driver in NetBeans, enabling the connection between your Java application and an SQLite database.

Steps:

Download the SQLite JDBC Driver
Visit a reliable source such as GitHub or Maven Central to download the latest version of the SQLite JDBC Driver (sqlite-jdbc-x.x.x.jar). Save the JAR file in your project directory or in an easily accessible location.

Add the JDBC Driver to NetBeans Project
To integrate the SQLite JDBC driver into your NetBeans project, follow these steps:

Open NetBeans and navigate to your project in the Projects window.
Right-click on your project name and select Properties.
In the Project Properties window, click on Libraries from the left panel.
Click Add JAR/Folder.
In the file dialog that opens, navigate to the location where you saved the sqlite-jdbc-x.x.x.jar file.
Select the JAR file and click Open.
The driver should now appear under Libraries in your project's Properties.
Verify Driver Installation in NetBeans Database Tool
To ensure that NetBeans recognizes the SQLite JDBC driver, follow these steps:

Open the Services tab in NetBeans.
Expand the Databases section.
Right-click Databases and choose New Connection.
Select SQLite (JDBC) as the driver.
If you see the SQLite JDBC driver listed in the connection options, it has been successfully integrated.
Write and Execute a Test Java Program
After the JDBC driver is added, write a small Java program to confirm that the driver is functioning properly.

Example Code: SQLiteTest.java


import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class SQLiteTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:sqlite:/path/to/your/database.db";  // Replace with actual path
        try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url)) {
            if (conn != null) {
                System.out.println("Connection to SQLite has been established.");
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}


Replace /path/to/your/database.db with the actual path to your SQLite database.
The program attempts to establish a connection to the database and prints a success message.
Running the Program:

In NetBeans, right-click on your SQLiteTest.java file.
Select Run File.
If the connection is successful, you will see the output: Connection to SQLite has been established.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, consider the following steps:
Ensure File Names Match: If you encounter a compilation error, ensure that the filename matches the public class name (e.g., SQLiteTest.java for the class public class SQLiteTest).
Check JAR File: Ensure that you have the correct SQLite JDBC JAR version.
Database Path: Double-check the path to your SQLite database file.
