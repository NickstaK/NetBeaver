# SQLite Database Connection Setup in NetBeans

This document outlines the steps to configure a connection between **NetBeans** and an **SQLite** database. 

### Prerequisites:
- **NetBeans IDE** installed.
- **DBeaver** installed (to retrieve the SQLite connection URL).
- **SQLite JDBC Driver** (if it's not already available in NetBeans).

### Steps to Establish the SQLite Connection:

#### 1. Retrieve Connection URL from DBeaver:
1. Open **DBeaver** and connect to the SQLite database.
2. Right-click on the **SQLite connection** in the **Database Navigator**.
3. Select **Edit Connection**.
4. Copy the **JDBC URL** displayed in the **Connection Settings** ( `/home/NickstaK/sqlite/Chinook.db`).

#### 2. Configure NetBeans for SQLite:
1. Open **NetBeans** and go to the **Services** tab.
2. Right-click on **Databases** and select **New Connection**.
3. In the **New Connection Wizard**:
    - Choose **SQLite (JDBC)** as the database driver.
    - If **SQLite (JDBC)** is not listed, download the **SQLite JDBC driver** from [GitHub](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc), and add it in NetBeans via **New Driver**.
4. Paste the **JDBC URL** from DBeaver.
5. Leave the **username** and **password** fields blank (unless configured otherwise).
6. Click **Test Connection** to verify the connection.

#### 3. Test the Connection:
- If the connection is successful, you will see a message saying **"Connection successful"**.
- Click **Finish** to save the connection.

#### 4. Using the Database in NetBeans:
- The new connection will appear under **Databases** in the **Services** tab.
- You can now explore tables, run SQL queries, and interact with your SQLite database within NetBeans.

### Troubleshooting:
- Ensure that the SQLite JDBC driver is correctly added to NetBeans if the connection fails.
- Double-check the file path in the JDBC URL to ensure it's correct.
