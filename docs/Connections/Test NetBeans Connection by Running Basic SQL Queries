# Verifying Database Connection in NetBeans

This document outlines the steps to execute SQL queries in NetBeans to verify that the SQLite database connection is working correctly.

Prerequisites:
A working SQLite connection in NetBeans.
The Chinook database should be accessible.
Steps to Execute SQL Queries:
1. Open the SQL Editor:
Launch NetBeans and go to the Services tab.
In the Databases section, right-click on the connection to your SQLite database (e.g., Chinook).
Select Execute Command to open the SQL Editor.

2. Write a Basic SQL Query:
In the SQL Editor, write the following SQL query:

SELECT * FROM album LIMIT 5;
This query retrieves the first 5 records from the album table.

3. Execute the Query:
Click the Run button or press Ctrl + Enter to execute the query.
Verify that the results appear in the output window. You should see a list of the first 5 albums from the album table.

4. Troubleshooting:
If you get an error message:
Double-check the database connection to make sure it is configured correctly.
Review the query for syntax issues or table/column name errors.
